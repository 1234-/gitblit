# Gitblit #

Gitblit is an open source, pure Java Git solution for managing, viewing, and serving [Git](http://git-scm.com) repositories.

Gitblit is distributed in two variations:
  * **Gitblit GO** - a complete & integrated pure Java stack<br />This is what you should download if you want to go from zero to Git in less than 5 mins.  Gitblit GO is like a mashup of Apache httpd, Git, and Gitweb with simplified configuration and maintenance.<br />All dependencies are bundled.<br />
  * **Gitblit WAR** - a traditional WAR distribution<br />This is what you should download if you want to deploy Gitblit into your own servlet container (e.g. Tomcat, Jetty, etc).<br />All dependencies are bundled.
